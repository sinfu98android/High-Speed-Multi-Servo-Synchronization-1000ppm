# High-Speed Multi Servo Synchronization (1000 ppm)

## Introduction
End-to-end electronic camshaft replacement system achieving 1000 ppm cutting and gluing.<br>

## Architecture
- 6 coordinated servos<br>
- Master sync pulse (50–100 kHz)<br>
- 2 ms update rate<br>
- Electronic registration control<br>
- Multi-roll tension control<br>
## Features
- Electronic gear train<br>
- Eye-mark print correction<br>
- Real-time tension loops<br>
- Deterministic low-latency motion<br>

## Technical Highlights
- Servo-to-servo sync<br>
- Dedicated PLC-Servo protocol<br>
- Fully deterministic timing<br>
- End-to-end latency: ~2 ms<br>
## My Contribution
Full system design, implementation, tuning, test validation.<br>

Due to NDA, I cannot share machine videos — but I can share the architecture I personally designed and implemented.
